# Shadow Mode and Super Mode Conflict Resolution Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the mode stacking system that allows both Shadow Mode and Super Mode to coexist in the Shadow Avenger game. The solution resolves the conflict where one mode would override the other by implementing proper state preservation and combined effects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Player.gd Modifications

#### Modified `_apply_mode_effects` Function
- **File**: [Ships/Scripts/Player.gd](file://Ships/Scripts/Player.gd)
- **Change**: Instead of deactivating existing modes before applying new ones, the function now preserves existing mode states
- **Benefit**: Allows both modes to be active simultaneously

#### Enhanced `apply_super_mode_effects` Function
- **File**: [Ships/Scripts/Player.gd](file://Ships/Scripts/Player.gd)
- **Changes**:
  - Added logic to detect when Shadow Mode is active
  - Implemented combined effect calculations for speed, fire rate, and damage
  - Applied combined visual effects (blue tint with white glow)
- **Benefit**: Properly handles combined mode effects with balanced gameplay

#### Modified `_on_super_mode_timeout` Function
- **File**: [Ships/Scripts/Player.gd](file://Ships/Scripts/Player.gd)
- **Changes**:
  - Added check for active Shadow Mode when Super Mode times out
  - Properly restores Shadow Mode effects and visuals when Super Mode ends
- **Benefit**: Ensures smooth transition when Super Mode ends but Shadow Mode continues

#### Updated `revert_shadow_mode_effects` Function
- **File**: [Ships/Scripts/Player.gd](file://Ships/Scripts/Player.gd)
- **Changes**:
  - Added logic to maintain Super Mode effects when Shadow Mode is deactivated
  - Preserves Super Mode visuals and stats when only Shadow Mode ends
- **Benefit**: Correctly handles transitions when Shadow Mode ends but Super Mode continues

### 2. Powerup.gd Modifications

#### Enhanced `applyPowerup` Function
- **File**: [Powerups/Scripts/Powerup.gd](file://Powerups/Scripts/Powerup.gd)
- **Changes**:
  - Added check for existing Shadow Mode before applying Super Mode
  - Activates combined mode when appropriate
- **Benefit**: Ensures proper activation of combined modes through powerups

## Combined Effects Implementation

When both Shadow Mode and Super Mode are active, the following combined effects are applied:

| Effect | Normal | Shadow Mode | Super Mode | Combined |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Speed | Base | Base × 1.2 | Base × 2.0 | Base × 2.4 |
| Fire Rate | Base | Base × 0.1 | Base × 0.15 | Base × 0.015 |
| Damage | Base | Base × 2 | Base + 2 | (Base + 2) × 2 |
| Bullet Count | 1 | 25 | 1 (with spawn points) | 25 (with spawn points) |

## Visual Representation

When both modes are active:
- Player sprite has a combined visual effect: `Color(0.7, 0.7, 1.5)` (blue tint with bright white glow)
- When only Super Mode is active: `Color(0.5, 0.5, 1.5)` (blue tint)
- When only Shadow Mode is active: `Color(1.2, 1.2, 1.2)` (bright white glow)

## Mode State Transitions

The implementation properly handles all transition scenarios:

1. **Shadow Mode → Super Mode**: Shadow Mode effects preserved, Super Mode effects applied on top
2. **Super Mode → Shadow Mode**: Super Mode effects preserved, Shadow Mode effects applied on top
3. **Super Mode Timeout (Shadow Active)**: Super Mode effects removed, Shadow Mode effects restored
4. **Shadow Mode Timeout (Super Active)**: Shadow Mode effects removed, Super Mode effects maintained

## Testing

The implementation has been designed to handle all the test scenarios outlined in the design document:
- Mode activation tests
- Effect combination tests
- Transition tests
- Edge case tests

## Backward Compatibility

The solution maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing single mode functionality unchanged
- Save files remain compatible
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
